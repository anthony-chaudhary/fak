// Package containment is a tier-primitive leaf (describe its single responsibility).
//
// Tier: primitive (1) - see internal/architest. This package may import only
// packages whose tier is <= 1; an upward import fails the architest gate.
// See AGENTS.md and internal/architest for the layering contract.
