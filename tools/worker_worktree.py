r"""worker_worktree.py — per-worker git worktree isolation for dispatch workers,
reconciled with the trunk-only commit rule (#1334).

THE PROBLEM (from #1334)
------------------------
Every dispatch worker launches with ``cwd = repo root``
(``issue_resolve_dispatch.spawn_issue_worker`` runs in the trunk worktree). So N
concurrent workers share ONE working tree, ONE index, and ONE Go build cache on
the trunk:

  * a worker mid-edit leaves a half-built package that REDS another worker's
    ``go build`` / ``make ci`` (build-poisoning);
  * ``git commit -- <paths>`` from two workers races on the shared index;
  * uncommitted WIP from a stalled worker entangles the next worker's diff.

This is the dominant throughput killer past ~4 concurrent workers and the hard
blocker to scaling the spawn loop toward 100 (#1333).

THE TENSION THIS RECONCILES
---------------------------
``CLAUDE.md`` / ``AGENTS.md``: *never open a feature branch or new worktree — the
trunk guard refuses off-trunk commits (``OFF_TRUNK``)*. And git itself refuses two
worktrees checked out on the SAME branch. So a naive "give each worker a worktree
on ``main``" both trips ``OFF_TRUNK`` (a branch worktree) AND is refused by git
(``main`` is already checked out in the primary).

The reconciliation, the design content of the issue:

  1. Each worker EDITS in its own throwaway worktree checked out at a DETACHED
     HEAD pinned to the current trunk SHA — ``git worktree add --detach <dir>
     <trunk-sha>``. A detached worktree is NOT on ``main`` (so git does not refuse
     it) and is NOT on a feature branch (so it can never be the thing that trips
     ``OFF_TRUNK``). It is an isolated working tree + index; pointing ``GOCACHE`` /
     ``GOTMPDIR`` into it isolates the build too, so a broken build in one worker's
     worktree cannot red another's. (This is the exact pattern the repo's own
     ``fak-selfupdate-build-*`` worktrees already use — strong in-repo precedent.)

  2. The worker's change LANDS on the trunk through a SERIALIZED commit-to-trunk
     step (:func:`land_worktree_diff`): the worktree's diff is applied to the
     trunk worktree and committed there as a normal stamped, signed-off commit
     ``ON main``. Nothing ever commits off-trunk, so ``OFF_TRUNK`` never trips, and
     the trunk stays linear and guarded. Serialization is provided by the lane
     lease the dispatcher already holds (``issue_resolve_dispatch.acquire_lane_lease``)
     — one worker per leaf tree means at most one apply per tree at a time.

DONE-CONDITION (the issue's acceptance, restated as this module's contract)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * During an N-worker wave, :func:`prepare_worker_worktree` yields N isolated
    detached worktrees (``git worktree list`` shows one per live worker).
  * A broken build in one worktree does not red another: each worker's
    ``GOCACHE`` / ``GOTMPDIR`` live INSIDE its own worktree (:func:`worktree_env`).
  * The trunk accumulates NO anonymous cross-worker WIP: a worker edits in its
    worktree, and the only thing that touches the trunk is the serialized
    :func:`land_worktree_diff`, which commits the worker's change as its OWN
    stamped commit.

SAFETY STANCE
-------------
Everything here is FAIL-OPEN and idempotent, the same discipline as
``issue_resolve_dispatch``'s lease/witness helpers: a git error never raises
through these functions (it is reported in the returned dict), so wiring the
isolation in can only ever ADD the isolation, never wedge the dispatcher. The
PURE planners (path/name/env composition) are unit-tested without touching git;
the git-touching create/reap/land functions take an injectable ``git`` runner so
the whole acquire→edit→land→reap path is exercised with a fake.

This module is the reusable PRIMITIVE, and its :func:`main` CLI (``prepare`` /
``land`` / ``reap`` / ``list``) makes it RUNNABLE: a guarded fak instance, an
operator, or a self-source dispatch ticket that hits ``SELF_MODIFY_HOLD`` can now
drive the full acquire → edit → land → reap cycle from the shell instead of
following a prose pointer at "#1334" that resolved to nothing invokable —

    wt=$(python tools/worker_worktree.py --root . prepare --lane cmd --key 1338 | jq -r .path)
    # ...edit the self-source files INSIDE $wt (its own isolated detached worktree)...
    python tools/worker_worktree.py --root . land --worktree "$wt" \
        --msg-file msg.txt --path cmd/fak/foo.go
    python tools/worker_worktree.py --root . reap --worktree "$wt"

AUTO-wiring the live dispatch spawn (passing the worktree dir as each worker's
``cwd`` and landing on exit, so a self-source ticket flows through this WITHOUT
an operator in the loop) remains the follow-on (#1333's worktree-isolation
blocker) that builds on this runnable path. The primitive + CLI land first,
tested and dog-fooded, so that wiring has a witnessed foundation. Pure stdlib;
no deps.
